// bin/supervise-poll.mjs - One poll's readings and its decision, in one process.
//
// bin/supervise.sh runs this once per poll. It reads the clock, the child's
// own heartbeat file, the decision store, the run directory's restart request
// and mailbox, the tail and size of the child's stream and the harness
// transcript, takes the liveness verdict on them, hands the lot to the decide
// unit, and prints what the poll loop acts on. Each store reading follows the
// shell helper of the same name in bin/supervise.sh and bin/agentic-common.sh,
// which the paths outside the poll loop still call. A process launch under
// Git for Windows costs tenths of a second on a loaded box, so a poll that
// launches one process per reading spends longer reading than it sleeps.
//
// It writes to one file, the mailbox, through one writer (appendMailboxRecord):
// a probe where the child's heartbeat is stale and no probe has been written
// inside supervisorProbeMs, and the shutdown ask where <rundir>/shutdown.request
// is present and no ask to this child is open. Each record is built with
// JSON.stringify and ends in a newline, since the plugin parses that file and
// leaves a line with no newline yet for its next tick.
//
// Arguments, all positional so the MSYS launcher converts each path:
//   1 the child's own heartbeat file, <rundir>/heartbeat.json
//   2 store path            3 persona              4 child stream path
//   5 profile root the harness keeps its transcripts under ('' where unknown)
//   6 child session id ('' until the init line names one)
//   7 childStartTs          8 launchedAt           9 staleAfterMs
//  10 minRunMs             11 maxRestartsPerHour  12 crashCount
//  13 restartCount         14 crashLimit
//  15 run directory, which holds the restart.request file the coordinator's
//     fleet_restart tool writes ('' or absent where there is none to read)
//  16 working directory in Windows form, which names the transcript's project
//  17 the process walk this poll ran: live, none, or failed
//  18 the stream's size as the last poll saw it ('' before any poll has)
//  19 when the last poll saw that size change, epoch ms
//  20 supervisorSilenceBoundMs  21 supervisorProbeMs  22 the probe's window
//  23 supervisorFinalAskMs      24 when the final ask was written ('' if none)
//  25 the supervisor's start time, epoch ms, which prefixes every probe id
//  26 the mailbox, <rundir>/mailbox.jsonl
//  27 the plugin's ack file, <rundir>/mailbox.ack.jsonl
//  28 supervisorAskGraceMs
//  29 the open shutdown ask's id ('' if none)
//  30 when that ask was written, epoch ms ('' if none)
//  31 the shutdown ask's text, which bin/supervise.sh holds as
//     SUPERVISOR_SHUTDOWN_TEXT
// A caller passing only the first fifteen gets a walk read as incomplete,
// which reads alive: no liveness restart without the readings that earn it.
// A caller passing no mailbox writes no record of either kind.
//
// Prints eleven lines:
//   action
//   reason
//   <rate-limit reset epoch ms> <ISO 8601>, or "- -" where the child is not parked
//   child session id, or an empty line where the stream does not name one yet
//   <verdict> <reason>, the liveness reading, e.g. "alive signal"
//   the stream's size now, or an empty line where it cannot be read
//   when that size last changed, epoch ms, or an empty line
//   the final ask's time for the next poll to hand in, or an empty line
//   HEARTBEAT_ABSENT where the heartbeat file was never written and the
//     startup grace is over, or "-"
//   the open shutdown ask's id for the next poll to hand in, or an empty line
