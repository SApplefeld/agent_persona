// bin/supervise-turnstate.mjs - Is the child inside a turn, or between them.
//
// bin/supervise.sh's patient restart_passive stop reads this before it lets
// an extended wait end: a child mid-turn gets more time, a child that has
// finished one and gone quiet does not. It takes the child's own
// child-<n>/stdout.jsonl and a clock value, and answers from the newest
// conversational record it can find, touching nothing else the child wrote.
//
// Arguments, both positional:
//   1 path to child-<n>/stdout.jsonl
//   2 clock value in epoch milliseconds, used as "now" when aging a quiet
//     text-only reply. Milliseconds, not seconds: a value too small to be a
//     plausible epoch-ms "now" is not trusted as a mis-scaled clock, and
//     Date.now() is used in its place instead.
//
// Prints exactly one word, busy or idle, and nothing else. Most failure paths
// -- a missing file, an unreadable one, a tail whose scan reaches the start
// of the file and holds no conversational record or turn-start marker --
// read idle, so a fault in this reader falls back to the stop phases'
// behavior before this module existed, rather than holding a dead child's
// persona for the patient cap. Where the tail's scan does not reach the
// start of the file and neither is found, this reads busy on purpose: a
// record (or run of records) wider than the widening ceiling sits behind the
// window, and giving up and reading idle there is the kill-a-working-child
// direction (see the widening note below).
//
// Conversational records are of type assistant and user; rate_limit_event
// records are skipped when looking for the newest one, as are system records
// other than the two turn-start subtypes described below. A user record
// reads busy (the model owes a reply). An assistant record carrying a
// tool_use block reads busy (a tool is running). An assistant record with no
// tool_use block reads busy while younger than five minutes and idle once
// older. Inside a turn, the record that follows a text-only record is most
// often a tool_use block of the same API response, and the stream writes
// nothing while the model generates that block's input, which scales with
// the input's size: inputs of 26 to 34 kilobytes took 90 to 135 seconds on
// live streams, and no such gap over 150 seconds was measured across 6,324
// mid-turn records on four streams. The age is taken from that record's own
// timestamp field, not the file's modification time: a run of later system
// records (a rate-limit retry, an init line) can keep the file's mtime fresh
// long after the turn that produced the text reply has ended, and mtime
// aging would then misread that child as busy. The file's modification time
// is used only when the record carries no timestamp field the reader can
// parse.
//
// A channel-driven child's own prompt is never written to the stream as a
// user record: a new turn is visible only as a system record of subtype init,
// followed by a run of system records of subtype thinking_tokens while the
// model is still generating, and neither subtype carries a timestamp. Where
// one of those sits after the newest conversational record in the tail, or
// the tail holds one and no conversational record at all, this reads busy
// regardless of how old the previous reply is: the child has started a new
// turn, not gone quiet after the last one. Every other system subtype still
// leaves the verdict resting on the newest conversational record.
// Ahead of every other rule: the newest record of ANY type, not only the
// newest conversational one, is checked for a rate-limit shape first, and if
// it is one this reads idle regardless of what sits under it. A rate-limit
// record is a system record of subtype api_retry with error_status 429, or a
// rate_limit_event record whose rate_limit_info.status is rejected AND whose
// rate_limit_info does not show the child proceeding on overage. A
// rate_limit_event record is routine quota information emitted on ordinary
// API responses and carries this shape on almost every turn; most of them
// (status allowed or allowed_warning) describe a child that is not parked at
// all. A rejected status alone is not enough either: a child whose included
// quota is exhausted keeps writing a rejected record for the whole length of
// the tool call it is running while it proceeds on overage, and
// rate_limit_info.isUsingOverage true or rate_limit_info.overageStatus
// "allowed" is what that looks like on the wire. Either field reading as "the
// child proceeds" makes the record routine, not blocking. A record whose
// overage fields are missing, or whose status cannot be read at all, is not
// treated as parked, since erring that way reads busy and the other way can
// kill a working child. A child truly parked on a limit rewrites a rejected
// record with no overage fields, so its stream never goes quiet on its own,
// and it has nothing left to finish.
//
// It reads the file's tail and not the whole file: a real stream reaches
// tens of megabytes. The tail read mirrors readRateLimitReset in
// bin/supervise-poll.mjs (same scan window, same first/last partial-line
// drop), since that is the tree's only other reader of this same hostile
// path and there is nothing here to import: that file runs its own poll
// unconditionally at load, so importing it would run a poll as a side
// effect of loading this one. Unlike that reader, this one widens the
// window when the first pass turns up no conversational record: a single
// record (a large tool_result, say) can exceed the base window on its own,
// and reading no conversational record there is not the same fact as there
// being none in the file.
