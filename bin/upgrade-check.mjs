// bin/upgrade-check.mjs - The Claude Code upgrade check, in one process.
//
// A new engine build reaches the fleet only after one canary has run this.
// The function-hooks API is early access and changes between releases without
// notice, so every step here reads the new build itself rather than a claim
// about it. The verdict is computed from the rows, never judged: each step
// writes one row, and the last line printed names the verdict the exit code
// carries.
//
// Two verbs, because half the checks need a session that has already
// restarted onto the new build:
//
//   pre   node bin/upgrade-check.mjs pre --repo <checkout> --results <dir>
//                                        [--scratch <dir>] [--canary <persona>]
//         Steps 1 to 7, run from a scratch folder it creates empty so the
//         plugin finds no persona there and stays passive. Prints
//         "pre: clear to restart the canary onto <version> (run <id>)" where
//         steps 1 to 5 and 7 read pass or warn and step 6 reads pass or gap,
//         else "pre: triage <step list>".
//
//   post  node bin/upgrade-check.mjs post --run <id> --results <dir>
//                                         --rundir <dir> --tools <ok | fail: reason>
//         The mechanical half of step 8, written under the run id the pre
//         verdict printed, so one table holds both halves. The session that
//         runs it is the restarted one, and --tools carries the three tool
//         readings only a model can take.
//
// The steps, and what each catches:
//   1 versions   the build on disk, and the build this session is running.
//   2 types      the declarations the new build writes beside a plugin it loads
//                from a folder, read off a probe plugin made in the scratch
//                folder.
//   3 diff       what changed in that interface, and which changed names the
//                plugin's own hooks read.
//   4 compile    the hooks against the new types, with a control file the
//                types must reject. A clean exit with a compiling control
//                proves nothing, so that case reads fail.
//   5 validate   what the engine would refuse at load.
//   6 engine     the plugin's own tests through the real engine, where any
//                exist. None is a gap, never a pass.
//   7 smoke      one headless prompt, read for hooks the engine skipped,
//                results it refused and context it dropped.
//
// Results. Every row is appended to <results>/upgrade-checks.jsonl, which is
// append-only: a run adds lines and rewrites none, so the file is the record
// of every attempt at every version. <results>/upgrade-checks.md is
// regenerated whole from that file each run, and the regeneration is a pure
// function of the file's content, so a second regeneration over unchanged
// input produces the same bytes. `result` is one of a closed list: pass,
// warn, gap, fail, skipped. The files hold version strings, step names and
// evidence lines cut from command output; the smoke log itself stays in the
// scratch folder.
//
// Exits. 0 clear, 1 triage, 2 could not run, 3 failed. A missing --repo or --results, a
// --repo with no hooks/ directory, and a results directory that cannot be
// written all exit 2 before any step runs, with the reason printed: a run
// that cannot record its rows is not a run. A scratch folder that exists,
// holds files and carries no .upgrade-check-scratch marker also exits 2 and
// is left as it stands, since the scratch folder is emptied at the start of a
// run and only a folder this script made is its to empty. Every child process
// carries STEP_TIMEOUT_MS, and a step whose process outlives it reads fail
// with the evidence "timed out" rather than throwing, so the remaining steps
// still run and the verdict still prints. A child whose output passes the
// 16 MB buffer reads as that, in the same way.
//
// The engine binary is resolved against PATH by this script rather than by
// the platform. A bare command name on Windows resolves against the working
// directory before PATH, and the step's working directory is a scratch folder
// this script is about to write files into, so a file dropped there would run
// in place of the engine. The same resolution is what lets a test put a fake
// claude first on PATH. A .BAT or .CMD shim is passed over: running one needs
// cmd.exe, which substitutes the forwarded arguments into its command line
// before parsing them, and an argument carrying an odd number of quotes ends
// the quoted region and starts a second command.
