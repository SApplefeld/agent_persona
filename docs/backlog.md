## Suite hardening

## Commons claim staleness (found and fixed working agent_persona_passive-supervisor_v1.md, Items 2-3)

Fixed in Item 3 (Chapter 3): `agentic_identity`'s handler now releases its previous persona's commons claim on every switch, before claiming the new one.

The root cause: a session's commons entry (`hooks/commons.ts`, `claimResource`/`releaseResource`) keys liveness on one `lastSeen` field shared across every resource that session has ever claimed. Any commons write the session makes for its *current* persona refreshes that one field, which also refreshes the apparent liveness of every other claim the session is still carrying, including a `persona:X` claim for a persona it switched away from and never released - `agentic_identity` claimed the new persona but never released the old one, so a session that started as `default` and switched to `dev` kept a `persona:default` claim alive in commons for as long as it kept heartbeating as `dev`. Reproduced three times across two sessions (this session's own residue in Item 2, then an unrelated live sibling session's residue in Items 2 and 3), each time permanently demoting a fresh scratch child to a passive reader (`sess.isOwner = false`, one-way for the life of that session) the moment it tried to persist under `default`.

Residual caveat: the fix only takes effect for a session running the updated code. A session already live with the old code in memory (observed: one holding `persona:default`, `persona:relay`, `persona:dev`, and `reader:dev` simultaneously) keeps its already-leaked stale claim until it restarts. This is not mine to clear directly - it's another session's own commons state. If Item 7's `default`-persona live suites still see a wedged pre-gate after this fix lands, check for a live sibling session running pre-fix code before assuming a new regression.
