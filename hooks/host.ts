// host.ts: the one interface through which a module outside hooks/index.ts
// reaches the engine. Types only, no runtime code.
//
// The engine's loader follows `$` only into a function declared at the top
// level of hooks/index.ts and refuses the whole module, silently, where `$`
// is passed across an import. So `$` never leaves hooks/index.ts. Its
// top-level hostOf($) builds this object instead, each member an arrow making
// one full `$.noun.verb(...)` call at its own site, and a module declares
// what it needs as a Pick of this interface. The shape is flat rather than
// nested by noun because the flat shape is the one the loader has accepted.
//
// Built at each call site rather than cached in session state: `$` is
// rebuilt on a plugin reload and a cached closure set would hold the old one.

  // $.env.get("TYPESAFE_API_KEY"): the Jev bearer key, undefined where unset.

  // question overrides and the decision journal live under.
  getHome(): Promise<string | undefined>;
  // $.fs.read(path): rejects when the file is missing.

  // $.fs.exists(path): never rejects.
  fileExists(path: string): Promise<boolean>;
  // $.http.fetch(url, init): resolves { status, ok, headers, text } once the
  // body is read. Takes no timeout, so a caller races it against sleep.
  fetch(url: string, init?: HttpInit): Promise<HttpResponse>;
  // $.clock.sleep(ms): resolves after ms milliseconds. No abort signal, so a

}

// Every member above returns a promise, and that holds for engine calls whose
// published signature is synchronous. A host call is an op event, so
// $.clock.now() resolves to a number rather than returning one, against the
// `now: () => number` its own type declaration carries. No member wrapping a
// synchronous engine call belongs here for that reason: its declared type
// would be a lie tsc cannot catch, and a test fake returning the plain value
// would agree with the declaration and disagree with the engine. Code in this
// plugin reads the wall clock with Date.now() directly, as it does everywhere
// else.
