// plan-record.ts: done and progress read from a plan document.
//
// A queue entry that carries a planPath is judged from the plan document it
// names rather than from a count of turns. This module holds the three parts
// of that read. parsePlanRecord is a pure parser over the document's text,
// with no I/O, so its rules are testable on a string alone. resolvePlanDir
// chooses the directory to read under: the session's live directory, or the
// nearest ancestor of it inside the same checkout that holds the document.
// readPlanRecord joins a stored planPath onto that directory, looks for the
// document in the four places a plan can sit, and hands the text to the
// parser. hooks/index.ts calls the resolver and the reader at the end of each
// turn for the entry that was active when the turn started, when that entry
// has a plan.

// The parser's rules.
//
// Complete: the first line opening with "Status:" (any case) above the first
// "##" heading has the value "Complete", trimmed, as the whole value, ignoring
// case. "Status: Complete (archived)" and "Status: Completed" are not that
// value. A line with markup around the key, such as "**Status:**", does not
// open with "Status:" and is not that line. A "Status: Complete" line sitting
// below the first "##" heading is outside the header and is never read, so a
// header reading "Status: In Progress" governs over it. A document with no
// Status line in its header is simply not complete.
//
// The Chapters, Sections and Next rules below use the heading patterns and the
// block rule of the Discord board card in the broker's repository, in
// `broker/board/plans.ts`, which the external engine's own reading shares. The
// card and this parser therefore agree on which lines are headings, which
// blocks they open, the Chapter count and the section count of the same file.
// That agreement does not cover Complete, which keeps its own rule above, and
// it does not cover the Next: value, whose fold and cut are this plugin's own
// bound.
//
// A block is the lines after its heading up to the next block heading, a line
// opening "##" then whitespace then text. "###" and deeper headings never end
// a block, and neither does "##text" with no whitespace. Only the first
// heading of a block's name opens it: a second "## Chapters" or
// "## Sections of Work" further down is read as a foreign heading that ends
// whatever block is open.
//
// Chapters: the number of "### Chapter N" headings in the "## Chapters"
// block, with any whitespace run between the words. N is the digits; what
// follows them (a colon, a dash and a date, a suffix) is convention rather
// than the contract, so "### Chapter 1: title" counts. "### Interim board N"
// and a "### Chapter" with no number are not Chapters. The block heading is
// "##", whitespace, "Chapters", then nothing but whitespace, so
// "## Chapters (append-only)" opens no block and its Chapters count nothing.
// A document with no such block has zero.
//
// Sections: the number of "### N." headings inside the "## Sections of Work"
// block, where N is one or more digits followed by a period and whitespace.
// The block heading is "##", whitespace, "Sections of Work", then nothing but
// whitespace. A foreign "##" heading inside the block ends it early and drops
// every later section. That edge is the plan-doc contract's own, and the
// board card and the external engine count the same way, so a count that
// disagreed with theirs about the same file would be the wrong one. A "### N."
// line outside the block, and a "#### N." line inside it, count nothing. A
// document with no such block has zero.
//
// Next: the value of the first line opening with "Next:" under the
// highest-numbered Chapter, the Chapters being the headings the count above
// counts. Every line from a Chapter's heading to the next Chapter heading or
// the block's end is under it, an Interim board's lines included. A repeated
// number reads the later-written Chapter, the more recent account of it. The
// first Next: line the pattern matches ends the search whatever its value, so
// a bare "Next:" above a "Next: y" reads null. The value is folded to one line
// through oneLine, its whitespace runs collapsed to one space and trimmed,
// then cut to NEXT_LINE_MAX_CHARS code points, so an astral character is never
// halved. Collapsing first means whitespace never spends the cut. The cut
// first takes 2 x NEXT_LINE_MAX_CHARS UTF-16 units, which hold at least
// NEXT_LINE_MAX_CHARS code points, so the code-point array stays small however
// long the line is. An empty value reads null, as does a document with no
// Chapter or a highest Chapter with no Next: line, even where an earlier
// Chapter carries one. The key is case-sensitive and must open the line, as
// the contract reads it. Brackets in the value are kept as written.
